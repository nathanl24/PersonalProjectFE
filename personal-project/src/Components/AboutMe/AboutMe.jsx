            <p>
                Currently undertaking a reskilling/ bootcamp oppurtunity to learn how to operate as a full stack engineer.
                Built foundation of knowledge across front and back end development. Started my journey by learning a variety
                of GitHub, Git Bash, CSS, HTML, Javascript, ReactJs, Java, Springboot, SQL alongside other features and applications.

            <h1>Career Ambitions</h1>
            <p>
                Short term my plan is to absorb and develop my knowledgeas much as possible whilst still undertaking my
                reskilling oppurtunity. Within the near future I would be looking to secure a tech based role where I can
                use my learning and actively implement this into a working environment. Being able to make a positive contirbution
                and learning the workplace infrastructure.
                <br />
                <br />
                Long term I am looking to become profficient in a range of different skills and applications used within software
                engineering. I would want to be pushing myself to becoming a mentor or team lead to be able to support other engineers
                and to be able to provide a more positive impact within a workplace.
            </p>
